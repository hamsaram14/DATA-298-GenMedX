GenMedX is an innovative healthcare project that transforms emergency department data into an intelligent AI agent system. Using a sophisticated cloud pipeline built with Apache Airflow, the project processes MIMIC-IV ED clinical data from PhysioNet through automated cleaning and transformation workflows. For our Named Entity Recognition module, we utilize the NCBI Disease Corpus.
